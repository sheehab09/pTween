# pTween
some nerd wanted this so decided to put it here incase, this just shows a use case of the roblox-lua-promise(https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/)


in a nutsheel this thigey: 
pTween stands for PromiseTween
itâ€™s phrasing tween behaviour in the language of promises
so cancelling the promise => cancelling tween
so this allows them to do promisy stuff like chanining things to the tween being completed/cancelled etc
